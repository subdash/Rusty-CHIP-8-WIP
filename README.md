# Rusty-CHIP-8-WIP

## My first Rust project and first attempt at creating an emulator.

This emulator is (probably) fully functional. At the least it can load a ROM to display the IBM logo. All CHIP-8 OP codes are programmed, but I've seen some weird behavior with loading certain ROMs, so I can't say for sure that it's immaculate.

As an avid gamer, creating an emulator was a joy for me. Before doing this project, I never understood how a computer can takes 1s and 0s and do magical things with them.

I had tried assembly language before but it just didn't click. Knowing now that each set of bytes represents an instruction, possibly one with data encapsualted in it, that all makes sense now.

I don't claim to be some low-end programming wizard, but hey, now I get it.

This project is still unfinished, the code could be cleaned up a lot and I know for a fact that I'm not following all the best practices for writing safe and idiomatic Rust code.

I'm still quite proud of it though. :)
